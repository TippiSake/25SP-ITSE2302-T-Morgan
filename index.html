      <h1>Welcome to Houston Eastern European Resources Organization</h1>

        <!-- This is my intro paragraph -->
        <p>
          Welcome to the Houston Eastern European Resource Organization, also
          known as H.E.R.O. We are here to support those who have come to
          Houston, Texas, especially Ukrainians and other refugees from Eastern
          Europe. Our mission is to connect people with the resources they need
          to not only survive but thrive. This includes providing essential
          items like food and housing, as well as opportunities to build
          relationships, join community groups, and create meaningful
          connections. At H.E.R.O., we honor the strength and bravery of
          refugees, who we see as heroes for their courage in difficult times.
          Through our website, we help these HEROes rebuild their lives with
          dignity by offering the tools and community support they need. We
          believe in the power of working together to create a caring space
          where everyone can find the help they need to live fully and
          confidently.
        </p>

        <p>
          H.E.R.O. is dedicated to helping individuals and families find the
          specific resources they need for a successful transition. We assist in
          locating food banks and meal programs, affordable housing options, and
          employment opportunities tailored to their skills. We also connect
          refugees with education programs, including language courses and job
          training, to help them build a strong future. Understanding the
          importance of familiar communication, we offer guidance in finding
          doctors and healthcare providers who speak their language. We also
          connect individuals with local churches and civil organizations that
          share their cultural values and can offer additional support. At
          H.E.R.O., our goal is to ensure every person has access to the
          resources they need, not just to survive but to truly thrive in their
          new community.
